# Purpose
The Types tab is where you define custom data structures that you can use in your Smartform.
Key points:
- Create custom data types - You define your own structures or table types that don't exist in the SAP Data Dictionary
- Reusable structures - Once defined here, you can use them multiple times in Global Data or anywhere in the form
